Version 1.006 - Released 07/17/2024

Additions
- Added the missing OpenType features that handles ligation of two to four tally marks in a row so that they are in one character cell.

Changes
- Fix for major FontForge bug that recently happened to me that would make all the features an "rtla", causing language-specific features and ligatures to not work.
